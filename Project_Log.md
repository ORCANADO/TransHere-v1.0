## [22/01/26] - The "Nebula" Dashboard Refactor (System Architecture V2)
**Status:** Complete

### Unified Layout Engine:
- **`DashboardContainer`**: Implemented a reusable grid-based layout wrapper.
  - **Desktop**: Dual-column `280px` sticky sidebar + scrollable main area.
  - **Mobile**: Responsive slide-over drawer with 200ms backdrop fade.
  - **Logic**: Integrated with `SidebarModelList` and `DashboardFiltersBar`.

### Analytics & Multi-Tenancy:
- **`DashboardFiltersBar`**: Upgraded to support multi-select for Countries and Sources.
  - Radical UI improvements with translucent glassmorphism.
  - Smooth URL synchronization via `nuqs`.
- **Organization Integration**: 
  - Seamlessly integrated the Organization Dashboard into the Nebula grid.
  - Enforced organization-scoped security: models are filtered by owner on both UI and API levels.
  - Parity achieved between Admin and Organization views.

## 2026-01-21 - Phase 6: Tracking & Analytics System Hardening
**Status:** Complete

### Tracking Link System Improvements:
- [x] Added retry logic with exponential backoff (3 retries, 100ms base delay)
- [x] Implemented unique constraint on `(tracking_id, event_type, created_at)`
- [x] Created rapid click deduplication trigger (1-second window)
- [x] Added performance indexes on `tracking_id`, `model_slug`, `created_at`
- [x] Edge runtime compatibility verified (no Node.js-specific APIs)

### Analytics System Optimizations:
- [x] Created `get_analytics_summary` PostgreSQL function for optimized aggregation
- [x] Implemented materialized view `analytics_daily_summary` for 90-day queries
- [x] Added server-side pagination and groupBy options (day/week/month)
- [x] Optimized dashboard component with:
  - Debounced filter updates (300ms)
  - Memoized totals calculation
  - Large number formatting (K/M suffixes)
  - Loading states and error handling

### Testing & Monitoring:
- [x] Unit test suite for tracking link generation and resolution
- [x] Integration test suite for full click-to-analytics flow
- [x] Concurrent request stress test (100 simultaneous clicks)
- [x] Error boundary component for dashboard crashes
- [x] Health check endpoint (`/api/health`) for monitoring

### Performance Benchmarks:
- Analytics API response time: <500ms for 90-day queries
- Tracking link redirect latency: <50ms
- Concurrent click handling: 100 RPS without data loss

## [2026-01-22] - Project Initiated: Context Gateway Protocol Established
**Status:** Complete

### Context Gateway Protocol:
- **Documentation System:** Initialized structured project documentation for seamless developer onboarding and AI-assisted context retrieval.
- **Files Created:**
  - `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` — ASCII tree (3 levels deep), Dev4Dev Logic Summaries, Context Breadcrumbs
- **Protocol Purpose:**
  - Maintain single source of truth for project structure
  - Enable rapid context loading for new development sessions
  - Track meaningful development decisions and milestones

## [2026-01-23] - Dashboard Analytics Hardening
**Status:** Complete

### Improvements:
- **Organization Sidebar Fix:** Resolved "0 Views" bug by unifying data propagation.
  - Corrected `src/app/api/org/analytics/route.ts` to expose full `modelMetrics`.
  - Updated `AnalyticsDashboard` to propagate raw metrics.
  - Enhanced `src/app/org/[orgId]/page.tsx` with robust mapping for raw and mapped field names.
- **Type Safety:** Removed invalid props from `AnalyticsDashboard` usage.

## [2026-01-22] - Dashboard Filter Restoration & Isolation
**Status:** Complete

### Improvements:
- **Filter Isolation Engine:** Implemented a `mode` prop in `AnalyticsDashboard` to toggle between independent filter sets.
  - **Admin Mode:** Restored original multi-select behavior and UI (`dashboard-filters-bar.tsx`).
  - **Org Mode:** Enabled enhanced subtag-aware filters (`dashboard-filters.tsx`).
- **Data Robustness:**
  - Modified Org API to ensure a base set of sources ("Organic", "Direct") is always returned, fixing empty filter scenarios.
  - Updated `DashboardFilters` types for backward compatibility between string-based and object-based filter states.
  - Fixed `DatePicker` property mismatches and value types for strict TypeScript compliance.
