## Security Best Practices

### Protecting Your Access

1. **Never Share Your API Key**
   - Your key is unique to your organization
   - Sharing it gives others access to your data
   - If compromised, request a new key from admin

2. **Use HTTPS Only**
   - Always access via `https://transhere.vip`
   - Never use `http://` (without the 's')
   - Look for the padlock icon in your browser

3. **Secure Your Device**
   - Use a password/PIN on your device
   - Log out of shared computers
   - Don't leave dashboard open unattended

4. **Use Incognito Mode on Shared Devices**
   - Open an incognito/private window
   - Access your dashboard
   - Close the window when done
   - This prevents the URL from being saved in history

### If Your Key is Compromised

**Signs your key might be compromised:**
- Unexpected changes in your data
- Dashboard accessed from unknown locations
- Suspicious activity reports

**What to do:**
1. Contact your administrator immediately
2. Request a new API key
3. Update your bookmarks with the new URL
4. Monitor your dashboard for unusual activity

## Troubleshooting
